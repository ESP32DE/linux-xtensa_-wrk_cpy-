	  Xtensa processors are 32-bit RISC machines designed by Tensilica
	  primarily for embedded systems.  These processors are both
	  configurable and extensible.  The Linux port to the Xtensa
	  architecture supports all processor configurations and extensions,
	  with reasonable minimum requirements, including the Diamond 232L
	  Standard Core.  The Xtensa Linux project has
	  a home page at <http://xtensa.sourceforge.net/>.

config XTENSA_UNALIGNED_USER

	---help---
	   The Xtensa architecture currently does not handle unaligned
	   memory accesses in hardware but through an exception handler.
	   Per default, unaligned memory accesses are disabled in user space.

	   Say Y here to enable unaligned memory access in user space.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	---help---
           This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
           real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
           be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
           Unfortunately the kernel code has some race conditions if both
           CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are enabled, so this option is
           currently disabled if you are building an SMP kernel.

           Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
           or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

	  On some platforms (XT2000, for example), the CPU clock rate can
	  vary.  The frequency can be determined, however, by measuring
	  against a well known, fixed frequency, such as an UART oscillator.

	  On some architectures (EBSA110 and CATS), there is currently no way
	  for the boot loader to pass arguments to the kernel. For these
	  architectures, you should supply some command-line options at build
	  time by entering them here. As a minimum, you should specify the

	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a

	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

config HOTPLUG

	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	---help---
	Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	to use devices as you hotplug them.

          This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
          "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
	  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel.
